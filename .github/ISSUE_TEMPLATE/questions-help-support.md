## Habitat-Sim version
vx.x.x

Habitat is under active development, and we advise users to restrict themselves to stable releases. Are you using the latest [release version](https://github.com/facebookresearch/habitat-sim/releases) of Habitat-Sim? If not, why not?
(We may not be able to help with problems in earlier versions.)

Master branch contains 'bleeding edge' code and should be used at your own risk.
