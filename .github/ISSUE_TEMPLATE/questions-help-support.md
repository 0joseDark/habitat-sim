## Habitat-Sim version
vX

Habitat is under active development, and we advise users to restrict themselves to [stable releases](https://github.com/facebookresearch/habitat-sim/releases). Are you using the latest [release version](https://github.com/facebookresearch/habitat-sim/releases)? 
(We may not be able to help with problems in earlier versions.) 

Master branch contains 'bleeding edge' code and should be used at your own risk.
